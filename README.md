## C

- In gcc, you can use the ISO C11 specification with ``-std=c11``, and issue warnings for anything that violates it with ``-pedantic``.
- A function with a void return type in C shall not have a return statement with an expression. (But this is allowed in C++.)

## shell

- There is no difference in priority between logical AND and logical OR operations in sh.
